In Japan, you can get toasty with the new version of the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha topped with tiny white chocolate covered marshmallows. In Europe, you can try the new Caramel Waffle Latte, inspired by Dutch stroopwafel. And in South Korea, you can enjoy a sweet and slightly savory Golden Wish Latte with flavors of sweet potatoes and sour cream. And can you guess the one Starbucks holiday beverage that is served everywhere around the world? (Hint, hint, everyone loves Peppermint!)

Here’s a sampling of the unique flavors you’ll find on Starbucks holiday menus around the world this year.
